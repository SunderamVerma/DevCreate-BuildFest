### User Experience Improvements
1. **Visual Learning**: Complex textual descriptions replaced with interactive visuals
2. **Engagement**: Users can actively participate in diagram creation and modification
3. **Collaboration**: Visual tools facilitate better stakeholder communication
4. **Efficiency**: Quick template-based diagram generation
5. **Export Capability**: Diagrams can be saved and shared

## Enhanced Control Flow Features

### Wire Connections in System Architecture
The architecture diagrams now include sophisticated wire connections that clearly show:

1. **Data Flow Direction**: Arrows indicate the direction of data movement
2. **Operation Types**: Each connection is labeled with the type of operation (e.g., "HTTP Request", "Data Query", "Authentication")
3. **Flow Priority**: 
   - **Thick animated lines** (3px): Critical user flows and primary operations
   - **Medium lines** (2px): Standard business operations
   - **Thin lines** (1px): Secondary or fallback operations
   - **Dashed lines**: Optional or conditional flows
4. **Color Coding**:
   - **Blue**: Primary user interactions
   - **Red**: Critical business operations
   - **Cyan**: Core business logic processing
   - **Green**: Standard API requests
   - **Orange**: Authentication and security
   - **Gray**: Fallback/optional connections

### Interactive Flow Controls
- **Label Toggle**: Show/hide connection labels for cleaner views
- **Flow Legend**: Visual guide explaining different connection types
- **Flow Guide Panel**: Detailed explanations of system flows
- **Category Filtering**: Focus on specific architectural layers

### Real-time Flow Animation
- Primary data paths show animated flow indicators
- Critical operations pulse to show active processing
- Visual feedback for system load and data movement

### Dependencies Added
- `@xyflow/react`: Modern React Flow library for flowcharts and node-based diagrams
- `mermaid`: Diagram and flowchart rendering
- `react-xarrows`: Connection lines between elements
- `rough-notation`: Annotations and highlights
- `lucide-react`: Modern icon library
- `d3`: Data visualization utilities

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: All diagrams work across different screen sizes
- **Real-time Updates**: Diagrams reflect current project state
- **Interactive Elements**: Click, drag, edit functionality throughout
- **Export/Save**: Most components support saving and sharing
- **Customizable**: Templates can be modified and extended

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to any SDLC step that supports diagrams
2. Look for tabs above the content area (Content, Flowchart, Wireframes, etc.)
3. Click the floating green button (bottom-left) to see all diagram features
4. Use the interactive tools to create and modify diagrams
5. Save your work using the save buttons in each component

### For Developers
1. Import the desired diagram component
2. Pass appropriate props (step info, current state, callbacks)
3. The components are self-contained and handle their own state
4. Extend templates by modifying the predefined node/edge arrays

## Benefits
